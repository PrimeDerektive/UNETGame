To use the effects, you need to import everything except the "KunaiEditor" and "Demo" to your project.

There are also two optional folders you can import:

"Demo" - This contains the web demo as linked to on the Asset Store.

"KunaiEditor" - This is a tool that lets you scale multiple particle effects at once.

F.A.Q.:
------------------

Q: I'm getting a lot of "AABB" errors when testing the demo or importing the effects to my project

A: There is a bug with Unity 5.3, and can be fixed by updating to 5.3.1p2 or later versions.

-

Q: I think this pack is missing something / This pack doesn't have an effect like this

A: If you have any suggestions for additional content, feel free to send me an e-mail, and it might just be featured in the next version.

-

Q: Can you help me with coding?
A: I am unfortunately not a very skilled programmer, but you can get help at Unity Answers: http://answers.unity3d.com/
